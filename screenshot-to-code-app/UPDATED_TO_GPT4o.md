# ✅ UPDATED TO GPT-4o!

## What Changed

I've updated all API routes to use **GPT-4o** instead of GPT-4 Vision.

### Why This is Better:

✅ **Works immediately** - No Tier 1 required
✅ **Has vision** - Can analyze screenshots perfectly
✅ **Newer model** - Released in 2024, more advanced
✅ **Cheaper** - $2.50 per 1M tokens vs $10
✅ **Faster** - Quicker response times
✅ **Better results** - Often outperforms gpt-4-vision-preview

---

## Files Updated:

1. ✅ `app/api/analyze/route.ts` - Changed to `gpt-4o`
2. ✅ `app/api/adjust/route.ts` - Changed to `gpt-4o`
3. ✅ `app/api/export/route.ts` - Changed to `gpt-4o`

## Your API Key Will Work Now!

With `gpt-4o`, your API key should work immediately as long as you have:
- ✅ Valid OpenAI API key
- ✅ Payment method added (credit card)
- ✅ At least $5 in credits (or free trial credits)

## Cost Comparison:

### Old (GPT-4 Vision):
- $10 per 1M input tokens
- $30 per 1M output tokens

### New (GPT-4o):
- $2.50 per 1M input tokens  ← **75% cheaper!**
- $10 per 1M output tokens   ← **67% cheaper!**

**Real world cost per screenshot: ~$0.01-0.02** (vs $0.03-0.05 before)

---

## What to Do Now:

1. **Re-deploy** your app (push to GitHub again)
2. **Test** - Upload a screenshot
3. **It should work!**

---

## If You Already Deployed:

### Update Your Deployment:

```bash
# Go to your project folder
cd screenshot-to-code-app

# Add the changes
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Update to GPT-4o"

# Push to GitHub
git push
```

Vercel will **automatically redeploy** in 1-2 minutes!

## Test Your API Key First (Optional):

Want to verify your key works? Go to:
https://platform.openai.com/playground

Select `gpt-4o` from the dropdown and try a message. If it works there, it'll work in your app!

---

## 🎉 You're All Set!

Your app now uses the best available model that works with all API keys (that have payment method added).

Deploy and test! 🚀
